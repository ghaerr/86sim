# 86sim

A lightweight 8086 CPU emulator and disassembler that runs ELKS (a.out)
and MSDOS (MZ header) executables outside their respective operating systems.

Developed on macOS, should run on Linux.

Original 8086 emulator from [Andrew Jenner's Reenigne Project](https://github.com/reenigne/reenigne/tree/master/8088/86sim).

Enhancements from TK Chia's [fork](https://github.com/tkchia/reenigne/blob/master/8088/86sim/86sim.cpp) of that project.

ELKS and disassembly support is a work in progress.
